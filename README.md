### Bot that uses discord.py to parse .dmp files (zipped dump files supported)


# This bot has to be run as admin because of absolute file paths that WinDbg requires
* Uses the paste.rtech.support API for output



# To set up
1) Make sure the x64 bit version of WinDBG is installed
2) Create config.py according to the template in the same directory as DBGparser.py, fill in your bot's API token as well as the channel for sending the output
3) Run DBGparser.py as admin
